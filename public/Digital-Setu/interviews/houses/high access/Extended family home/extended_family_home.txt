👤 PERSONAL CONTEXT

26-year-old married woman from Majhuwa, agriculture and homemaker. Lives in large extended family (15 members). Uses phone 6-7 hours daily and is excited to learn new technology, but faces technical limitations.

📱 TECHNOLOGY ENTHUSIASM & FRUSTRATION

"I'm excited to learn new technology, but when I face obstacles I repeat it for a bit, then if I can't figure it out, I just leave it. Payment apps are important but they don't work on my phone - we tried a lot but couldn't get them working."

🛒 ONLINE SHOPPING SCAM EXPERIENCE

"I ordered jewelry worth Rs. 2000 and got scammed - didn't receive the complete product. After that my trust level decreased in online shopping... but after seeing new stuff, I still want to order."

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 FAMILY DIGITAL DYNAMICS

"We taught Papa how to pick up calls and he learned a little bit, but Mummy doesn't have interest and we didn't teach her. My husband uses mobile banking but I don't. Women mostly watch TikTok, men watch bike and vehicle content."

🌱 DIGITAL AGRICULTURE

"When we grow new things, we use internet. Recently we're growing godachitra (passion fruit) and use YouTube for farming information."

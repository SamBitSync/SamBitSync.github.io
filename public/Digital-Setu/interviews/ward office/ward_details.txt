Ward details:
🗺️ LOCATION & SETTING

Bhimdhunga, Ward 8 of Nagarjun Municipality - 13km west of central Kathmandu. Nestled in hilly forested belt separating the valley from neighboring districts, representing the peri-urban transition zone.

🏘️ COMMUNITY STRUCTURE

Three distinct communities: Majhuwa, Thaple, and Bus Park area. Predominantly Tamang ethnic households with some Dalit and Brahmin families, each bringing different perspectives on technology adoption.

⚖️ DEVELOPMENT TRANSITION

Recently transformed from Village Development Committee to municipal ward - caught between traditional rural life and urban connectivity, creating unique digital adoption patterns.

💼 ECONOMIC & DIGITAL PROFILE

Most residents rely on semi-subsistence farming with few formal employment opportunities. Digital engagement varies dramatically by generation - from elderly non-users to youth heavily involved in mobile gaming, creating age-based digital divides within the same households.

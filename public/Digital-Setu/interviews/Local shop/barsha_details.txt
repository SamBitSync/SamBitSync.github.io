ðŸ‘¶ FEAR ABOUT CHILDREN & PHONES

"In this generation children are so difficult to handle. There is a fear - if we refuse to give them phones, they might take negative decisions. Various incidents happened due to refusing phones, they do suicide. That's why we're scared and have to act softly."

ðŸ’° PRACTICAL BUSINESS LOGIC

"It takes time for 10, 20 rupees to collect online, but if we have cash, we can buy things easily. That's why I don't use online payments."

ðŸ”„ GENERATIONAL CONFLICT

"Elderly people get angry - they say 'we didn't use phones and still our work gets done, but why do you need to use this phone every time?'"

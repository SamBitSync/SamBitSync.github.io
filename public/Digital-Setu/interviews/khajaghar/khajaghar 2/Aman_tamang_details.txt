ðŸ“± INTENSIVE GAMING LIFESTYLE


"I give a lot of my time to phone... In lunch break, we don't actually eat lunch but play mobile phones... if battery is low, I play it while charging"

Constant phone engagement throughout day - gaming during breaks, after school, while charging. Feels angry when games lag or hang, updates FreeFire regularly. Got phone during COVID for online classes but excitement centered on finally being able to play games instead of watching others.

"I think we learn more from smartboard... They show videos. They show exercise from youtube... We can find books there as well. We don't have to carry one"

Uses YouTube for homework help, attempted ChatGPT for exams (caught by teacher). School has smartboards and wifi, recommends internet use for study. Prefers smartboard over whiteboard learning. Teachers encourage online educational resources.

ðŸ‘¶ DIGITAL IDENTITY MANAGEMENT


"I have 3 facebook id... One for school like school groups, one for friends and one for personal... It's only me. I don't think they have lots of ids"

Unique approach to social media with separate accounts for different contexts. Distrusts online shopping based on friends' warnings about second-hand products. Successfully topped-up gaming accounts through trusted friend connections without being scammed.

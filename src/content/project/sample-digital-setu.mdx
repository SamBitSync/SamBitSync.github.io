# Bhimdhunga Digital Divide Storymap

This is a sample Project post for a completed deliverable.

## Overview

An interactive storymap documenting digital infrastructure, access patterns, and community perspectives in Bhimdhunga, Nepal. Combines interviews, photographs, and spatial data to tell the story of connectivity challenges in rural areas.

## Approach

### Research Design
- Mixed methods: interviews + infrastructure mapping
- Community-centered: local voices drive the narrative
- Visual-first: minimize text, maximize multimedia

### Technical Implementation
- HTML/CSS/JS for standalone deployment
- No external dependencies
- Works offline (critical for demo in low-connectivity areas)

## Key Findings

1. **Infrastructure exists but access is constrained** by affordability and digital literacy
2. **Mobile-first internet** shapes how people engage with technology
3. **Community networks** matter more than individual access

## Impact

- Used in policy discussions at district level
- Informed ICIMOD's connectivity research
- Created template for similar storymaps in other communities

## Reflection

### What Worked
- Community participation created authentic narrative
- Visual approach crossed language barriers
- Offline-first design enabled local sharing

### What I'd Change
- Add more quantitative data visualization
- Include temporal dimension (how has access changed?)
- Build in mechanisms for community updates

# Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition

This is a sample Maps post demonstrating the structure.

## The Pattern

Complexity science reveals emergence through constraint satisfaction at multiple scales. This same pattern appears in cognitive architecture.

## Mapping

- **Complexity**: Local interactions → Global patterns
- **Cognition**: Neural assemblies → Cognitive states
- **Both**: Bottom-up emergence constrained by top-down selection

## Visual Representation

(You can add Excalidraw diagrams, D3 visualizations, or other interactive components here using MDX)

## Implications

Understanding this mapping helps us:
1. Design better cognitive models
2. Predict emergent phenomena
3. Build more robust AI systems

## Next Steps

- Formalize the mapping mathematically
- Test predictions empirically
- Connect to Bayesian epistemology

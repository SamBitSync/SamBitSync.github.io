# Theories of Cognition

Different frameworks for understanding what cognition is and how it works.

## Computational Approaches

### Classical Computationalism
- **Framework**: [Computationalism](/meta/computationalism)
- **View**: Cognition as symbol manipulation
- **Key claim**: Mind is to brain as software is to hardware

### Functionalism
- **Framework**: [Functionalism](/meta/functionalism)
- **View**: Mental states defined by functional role
- **Key claim**: Multiple realizability - same function, different substrate

## Embodied/Embedded Approaches

### Embodied Cognition
- **Framework**: [Embodied Cognition](/meta/embodied-cognition)
- **View**: Cognition is inseparable from bodily experience
- **Key claim**: The body shapes cognitive processes

### Extended Mind
- **Framework**: [Extended Mind](/meta/extended-mind)
- **View**: Cognitive processes extend into environment
- **Key claim**: Tools and artifacts are literally part of cognition

## Process-Oriented Approaches

### Predictive Processing
- **Framework**: [Predictive Processing](/meta/predictive-processing)
- **View**: Brain as prediction machine minimizing error
- **Key claim**: Perception is controlled hallucination

### Complexity Theory Perspective
- **Map**: [Complexity Theory Meets Cognitive Architecture](/maps/complexity-cognition)
- **View**: Cognition as complex adaptive system
- **Key claim**: Mental phenomena emerge from self-organizing dynamics

## Cross-Domain Synthesis

## Open Questions

- Are these theories competing or complementary?
- Can computational and embodied views be reconciled?
- What phenomena does each theory explain best?
- What does each theory struggle to account for?

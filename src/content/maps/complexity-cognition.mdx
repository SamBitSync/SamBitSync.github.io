# Complexity Theory Meets Cognitive Architecture

## The Pattern

Both complex adaptive systems and cognitive architectures deal with similar fundamental problems:
- How do local interactions give rise to global patterns?
- How does feedback shape behavior over time?
- How do systems balance exploration and exploitation?

## Cognitive Systems as Complex Adaptive Systems

### Emergence in Cognition
Mental representations aren't stored in single neurons—they emerge from patterns of activation across networks. This is classic emergence: the whole has properties the parts don't.

### Self-Organization
Without a central controller, neural networks reorganize themselves through learning. Hebbian learning ("neurons that fire together wire together") is pure self-organization.

### Attractors and Stability
Both cognitive states and complex systems settle into attractors. A belief system is like a basin of attraction—perturbations get absorbed, major disruptions can shift you to a new basin.

## Systems Thinking Illuminates Cognition

Viewing cognition through complexity theory reveals:
- Why changing beliefs is hard (attractor basins)
- Why learning requires destabilization (phase transitions)
- Why distributed representations are robust (degeneracy)

## Open Questions

- Can we map specific cognitive phenomena to dynamical systems math?
- What would a "complexity-native" cognitive architecture look like?
- How do cultural practices exploit (or fight) cognitive complexity?

# Fundamental Paradox of Social Science

## The Core Principle

The more **specific and localized** your investigation, the **broader and more generalizable** your claims can be.

Deep engagement with a particular case, context, or phenomenon often yields insights that travel further than broad surveys or aggregated data.

## The Paradox

Common intuition:
- Large sample, many cases → generalizable
- Small sample, one case → not generalizable

But often:
- Large sample → superficial patterns, context-stripped, atheoretical
- Deep case → reveals mechanisms, identifies scope conditions, theory-building

## Why It Works

### Mechanisms Over Patterns
Specific investigation reveals *how* things work, not just *that* they correlate. Mechanisms generalize better than correlations.

### Context as Data
Close study shows which features of context matter. This tells you where else the finding applies (scope conditions).

### Theory Development
You can't build theory from aggregated data alone. You need thick description, process tracing, understanding of local meaning. Then generalize *the theory*.

### Rich Variation
A single case over time, or one setting with internal variation, can reveal more causal structure than many cases measured once.

## Examples

### Ethnography
Deep ethnography in one community reveals mechanisms of social trust. The mechanisms (reciprocity, reputation, sanctioning) apply broadly, even if specific practices don't.

### Case Studies
Study of one organization's innovation process reveals general principles about how new ideas diffuse, get adopted, or fail—more than survey of 1000 organizations asking "did you innovate?"

### Clinical Research
Detailed study of a few patients with rare mutations reveals fundamental biology that explains common diseases.

### Experimental Iteration
Running many conditions with small N in each (deep exploration of parameter space) beats one condition with large N (just testing if an effect exists).

## Application to Research

### Study Design
Don't default to "bigger sample = better." Ask: Do I need breadth (establish prevalence) or depth (understand mechanism)?

### When to Go Deep
- Building theory (need to see process, not just outcome)
- Identifying mechanisms (need fine-grained observation)
- Finding scope conditions (need to vary context systematically)
- Explaining anomalies (need thick description)

### When to Go Broad
- Estimating prevalence
- Testing scope of established theory
- Finding rare cases
- Demonstrating robustness across contexts

### Combining Both
Ideal: Deep case study → develop theory → broad test → refine with more cases. Iterate.

## Limitations

### Not a License for Small N
The paradox doesn't mean "anything goes with one case." You need:
- Theoretical framework to interpret the case
- Clear reasoning about what generalizes (mechanisms) vs. what doesn't (particulars)
- Systematic within-case analysis, not cherry-picking

### Generalization Still Requires Argument
You must explain *why* this case reveals something general. What features are shared? What mechanisms travel?

### Risk of Overextension
Easy to mistake local particulars for universal mechanisms. Need external validity checks.

## Comparison to Related Principles

**vs. Inventor's Paradox:**
- Inventor's: Solving general problems helps with specific solutions
- Social Science: Studying specific cases helps make general claims
- Different phases: problem-solving vs. inference

**vs. Case Study Method:**
This is the *justification* for case study methods, but it's broader—applies to experimental depth, ethnography, clinical research, any intensive study.

## Connection to My Work

This principle shapes:
- **Research design:** Prefer iterative deep exploration over single large-N study
- **Modeling:** Fit models deeply to one context to understand mechanisms, then test breadth
- **Data collection:** Rich measurement in fewer cases rather than sparse in many
- **Theory building:** Use cases to develop theory, not just test pre-specified hypotheses

Examples:
- Rather than survey many trilingual speakers once, track fewer speakers intensively across contexts
- Rather than one big dataset, multiple smaller datasets with deeper measurement
- Rather than test one hypothesis broadly, explore mechanism space deeply

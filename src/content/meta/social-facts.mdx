# Social Facts

## The Core Concept

Émile Durkheim's foundational claim: **Social facts** are ways of acting, thinking, and feeling that are external to individuals, exist independently of any particular person, and exercise coercive power over individuals.

Social facts are not reducible to individual psychology. They constitute a distinct level of reality - the social.

## Examples of Social Facts

### Institutions
- Language: You don't invent it, you're born into it, it shapes what you can think
- Law: Exists before you, constrains your actions, persists after you
- Currency: Value depends on collective recognition, not individual belief

### Collective Representations
- Moral codes: What's shameful in one society is honorable in another
- Categories of thought: How we classify the world varies across cultures
- Suicide rates: Durkheim's classic - individual act, but rates are social facts (stable, vary systematically by social integration)

### Social Currents
- Fashions, panics, enthusiasms that sweep through populations
- Not located in any individual, but affect everyone

## What Makes Something a Social Fact?

### 1. Externality
Exists outside any particular individual's consciousness. You encounter it as already there.

### 2. Constraint
Exercises coercive power. Try speaking ungrammatically, violating norms, ignoring laws - you face resistance.

### 3. Independence
Persists across individuals. People die, the institution continues. New people arrive, the norms shape them.

## Why This Matters

### Against Reductionism
You can't explain social phenomena by aggregating individual psychology. The social has emergent properties.

### For Sociology as Science
If social facts exist, there's a distinct domain for social science. Not just applied psychology.

### Methodological Implications
- Study social facts with social facts (suicide rates explained by integration rates, not individual motives)
- Look for regularities at the social level
- Identify structural causes, not just individual intentions

## Tensions and Debates

**vs. Methodological Individualism:**
Individualists argue everything reduces to individuals and their interactions. Social facts theorists say no - the social is irreducible.

**How Much Constraint?**
Do social facts determine behavior or just constrain it? Room for agency?

**What About Change?**
If social facts are external and constraining, how do they ever change? Don't individuals change them?

## Connection to My Work

This framework shapes:
- **Level of analysis:** When to study individuals vs. social structures
- **Explanation:** When individual-level variables aren't enough (language shift rates, not just individual choices)
- **Data collection:** Measuring social-level variables (network density, institutional rules) not just aggregating individual surveys
- **Theory:** Recognizing when phenomena are emergent

Examples:
- Bilingualism isn't just individual proficiency - it's shaped by language policy, community norms, institutional recognition (social facts)
- Health disparities aren't just individual behaviors - they're patterned by social structures
- Research norms in a field aren't individual preferences - they're social facts that constrain what counts as legitimate

## Relation to Other Frameworks

- **Critical Realism:** Social facts exist in the "Real" domain - they're part of reality even when unobserved
- **Methodological Holism:** Social facts justify holism - you can't reduce to individuals
- **Emergence:** Social facts are emergent properties of social systems

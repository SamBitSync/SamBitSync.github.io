# Predictive Processing

## The Core Idea

**The brain is fundamentally a prediction machine.** All cognition - perception, action, learning - is about predicting sensory input and minimizing prediction error.

You don't passively receive information. You actively predict what you'll sense, and update predictions when you're wrong.

**Perception = prediction + error correction**

What you experience is your brain's best guess about what's out there, constantly refined by comparing predictions to actual sensory input.

## The Mechanism

### Hierarchical Generative Models
The brain has multi-level models of the world:

```
High-level (abstract): "There's a dog"
    ↓ predicts
Mid-level (features): "I'll see fur, four legs, tail"
    ↓ predicts
Low-level (sensory): "These pixel patterns"
    ↑
Actual sensory input
```

**Top-down:** Higher levels predict lower levels
**Bottom-up:** Prediction errors propagate upward when predictions fail

### Precision Weighting
Not all prediction errors matter equally. The brain weights errors by their reliability (precision):
- High precision error → update your predictions (something's wrong with your model)
- Low precision error → ignore it (probably just noise)

**Example:** In fog, visual errors have low precision - you trust your prior expectations more than sensory input.

### Active Inference
You can reduce prediction error two ways:
1. **Update your model** (perception/learning)
2. **Change the world** (action)

Action is prediction error minimization through doing, not just thinking.

**Example:** Predict "my arm will be up" → move arm up → prediction fulfilled.

## Why This Matters

### Unified Framework
Perception, action, learning, attention - all the same process (prediction error minimization) at different timescales.

### Explains Phenomena
- **Perceptual inference:** Why ambiguous images flip between interpretations
- **Attention:** Precision weighting determines what you notice
- **Learning:** Updating generative model based on persistent errors
- **Hallucinations:** When priors overwhelm sensory input
- **Action:** Fulfilling proprioceptive predictions

### Bayesian Brain
Predictive processing is Bayesian inference:
- Prior beliefs (predictions)
- Likelihood (sensory evidence)
- Posterior (updated belief after seeing data)

Brain does probabilistic inference, not logic.

## Application to Research

### Perception Studies
- Measure prediction vs. error signals in brain
- Manipulate precision (attention, reliability)
- Test how priors shape perception

### Language Processing
- Reading: Predict next word, measure surprise when wrong
- Comprehension: Generate predictions about meaning, update when violated
- Production: Predict articulatory/acoustic outcomes, execute to fulfill

**Bilingualism:**
- Do L1/L2 have different priors?
- Code-switching as context-dependent precision weighting?
- Error signals stronger in L2 (less precise predictions)?

### Psychopathology
- Depression: Overweighted negative priors
- Autism: Prediction-error processing differences
- Psychosis: Prior beliefs too strong (hallucinations) or too weak (delusions)

### Computational Modeling
- Formalize as hierarchical Bayesian inference
- Fit models to neural/behavioral data
- Derive predictions about learning rates, attention, perception

## Connection to My Work

This framework shapes:
- **Language processing:** Prediction-based parsing, anticipatory eye movements, surprisal effects
- **Bilingual control:** Precision-weighted competition between languages
- **Code-switching:** Prediction failures trigger language switch?
- **Learning:** L2 acquisition as building better generative model

Examples:
- Sentence processing: "The cat sat on the..." → predict "mat", surprised by "ceiling"
- Translation: Generate predictions in target language, minimize error
- Accent perception: Prior expectations shape what you hear
- Multilingual context: Context modulates precision of language-specific predictions

## Critiques and Limitations

### Is Everything Prediction?
Does predictive processing really explain all cognition, or just some aspects?
- Maybe perception/action, but does it explain reasoning, planning, memory?

### Computational Tractability
Exact Bayesian inference is intractable. How does brain approximate it?
- Various proposals (sampling, variational inference, heuristics)

### Content of Predictions
What determines the generative model? Where do priors come from?
- Evolution, development, learning - but this needs explaining

### Action Problem
Is action really just prediction fulfillment? What about novel actions, exploration?
- Active inference addresses this but critics say it's incomplete

### Neural Evidence
Is there enough direct evidence that brain implements hierarchical predictive coding?
- Some support, but also alternative interpretations of neural data

## Relation to Other Frameworks

- **vs. Computationalism:** Both computational but different: symbols vs. predictions, logic vs. inference
- **Compatible with Embodied Cognition:** Predictions include body state, action is integral
- **vs. Extended Mind:** Predictions happen in brain (though environment provides input)
- **Functionalism:** Predictive processing provides specific functional architecture
- **Critical Realism:** Generative models are about unobservable reality (Real), tested against observations (Empirical)

## Variants and Extensions

### Free Energy Principle (Friston)
All life minimizes variational free energy (bound on surprise). Predictive processing follows from thermodynamic imperative to resist entropy.

**Very ambitious:** Explains life itself, not just cognition.

### Predictive Coding
Specific neural implementation: error units, prediction units, hierarchical message passing.

### Active Inference
Emphasizes action as prediction fulfillment. Goal-directed behavior emerges from predicting desired states.

### Enactivist Predictive Processing (Kirchhoff, Kiverstein)
Combines predictive processing with enactive cognition. Predictions shaped by action-perception loops.

## Contemporary Status

**Very influential currently:**
- Unifies disparate phenomena
- Explains neuroscience findings
- Generates testable predictions
- Connects to machine learning (variational autoencoders)

**But also controversial:**
- Is it too ambitious?
- Does it really explain or just redescribe?
- Can it handle all of cognition?

# Embodied Cognition

## The Core Idea

**Cognition is not just in the brain processing abstract symbols. It's fundamentally shaped by:**
1. Having a body with particular form and capacities
2. Sensorimotor interactions with environment
3. Physical constraints and affordances

The body isn't just life support for the brain or input/output device. It constitutes, shapes, and grounds cognitive processes.

## Central Claims

### 1. Grounding
Abstract concepts are grounded in sensorimotor experience.

**Example:** Understanding "grasp" an idea literally involves neural reuse of motor grasping circuits. Metaphorical thought built on embodied foundations.

### 2. Situatedness
Cognition occurs in context of goal-directed action in environment, not detached symbol manipulation.

**Example:** Navigation isn't computing over internal maps - it's continuous sensorimotor coupling with landmarks.

### 3. Action-Oriented Representation
When we represent, we prepare for action.

**Example:** Seeing a cup activates motor programs for grasping. Perception is for action.

### 4. Body-Specific Cognition
Your particular body shapes what and how you think.

**Example:** Creatures with different bodies (birds, fish, octopuses) might literally think differently - not just know different things, but have different cognitive architecture.

## Evidence for Embodiment

### Conceptual Metaphors
Abstract thought uses bodily metaphors:
- "Warm" personality, "cold" shoulder (temperature → affect)
- Ideas are "up," sadness is "down" (spatial orientation → evaluation)
- Argument is war, love is journey (structural metaphors)

Not just linguistic - shapes actual reasoning.

### Gesture
People gesture when thinking, even when no one can see:
- Gestures aren't just communication
- They're part of thinking process
- Preventing gesture impairs reasoning

### Simulation
Understanding language activates sensorimotor simulations:
- Reading "kick" activates motor cortex for legs
- Reading "grasp" activates hand motor areas
- Comprehension involves mental simulation of actions/perceptions

### Body Posture Effects
Physical stance affects cognition:
- Arms crossed → more critical evaluation
- Expansive posture → confidence
- Not just correlation - causation (forcing posture changes thought)

## Versions of Embodied Cognition

### Weak Embodiment
Body constrains and influences cognition but doesn't constitute it. Still computational, just with bodily inputs.

### Strong Embodiment
Body partially constitutes cognition. Some cognitive processes literally are sensorimotor processes, not just influenced by them.

### Radical Embodiment
Reject computational/representational framework entirely. Cognition is direct coupling between organism and environment through action. No internal representations.

## Why This Matters

### Against Computationalism
If cognition is embodied, the computer metaphor is wrong. Brains don't manipulate abstract symbols - they control bodies in environments.

### For AI/Robotics
Disembodied AI might be impossible. Need humanoid robots with rich sensorimotor experience to get human-like intelligence.

### Understanding Cognition
To understand thinking, study body-environment interaction, not just brain states.

## Application to Research

### Language Grounding
How do words get meaning?
- Traditional: Symbols connected to other symbols
- Embodied: Words grounded in sensorimotor experience
- "Red" means something because of visual experience, "run" because of motor experience

### Learning
Abstract concepts learned through bodily metaphor:
- Math: Number line built on spatial experience
- Time: Understood through space metaphors
- Causation: Push/pull physical schemas

### Development
Cognitive development is sensorimotor development:
- Piaget's stages based on action schemes
- Learning to walk changes spatial cognition
- Tool use extends body schema

### Cross-Cultural Differences
If cognition is embodied, cultural practices that shape bodily experience shape thought:
- Languages with absolute spatial terms (north/south not left/right) → different navigation strategies
- Gesture conventions → different metaphor structures

## Connection to My Work

This framework shapes:
- **Language processing:** Words activate sensorimotor simulations, not just abstract features
- **Bilingualism:** Do different languages ground in different bodily experiences? Or same embodied foundation, different labels?
- **Metaphor:** Cross-linguistic metaphor variation reflects embodied universals vs. cultural specifics
- **Gesture:** Code-switching in speech + gesture - embodied basis of multilingual communication

Examples:
- Do bilinguals simulate differently in L1 vs L2?
- Gesture-speech integration: How does language switching affect gesture?
- Embodied translation: Translating action verbs requires sensorimotor simulation?
- Grounded representations: Language-specific motion encoding (manner vs. path) → different embodied simulations

## Limitations and Critiques

### Abstract Thought
How do you embody pure abstraction?
- Prime numbers, infinity, justice, democracy
- Can't all reduce to sensorimotor experience
- Maybe embodiment is scaffolding, not constitution

### Cross-Species
If human cognition is human-body-shaped, can we understand bat cognition? Octopus cognition?
- Radical embodiment suggests no - but that's implausible
- Some abstract principles must transcend embodiment

### Computational Success
Disembodied AI (ChatGPT, AlphaGo) succeeds. How, if embodiment is necessary?
- Maybe they're "superficially" intelligent without understanding?
- Or embodiment is one route but not the only route?

### Methodological
How do you test embodiment empirically?
- Hard to isolate body from brain
- Correlation doesn't prove constitution
- Simulation effects might be post-comprehension, not comprehension itself

## Relation to Other Frameworks

- **Extended Mind:** Both reject brain-bound cognition; Embodied focuses on body, Extended on environment
- **Functionalism:** Tension - functionalism says any implementation works, embodiment says body matters
- **Intentionality:** Embodiment offers account of content grounding (sensorimotor experience)
- **Situated Cognition:** Embodiment is version of situatedness (body-in-environment)

## Implications for Cognitive Science

### Methodology
- Don't just study brain in isolation
- Measure bodily states, actions, environmental interactions
- Virtual reality for studying embodiment

### Theory
- Replace/supplement computational models with dynamical systems
- Model body-environment coupling, not just internal processing
- Include sensorimotor simulations in language/thought models

### Applications
- Design: Interfaces that leverage embodied cognition
- Education: Learning through bodily action, not just abstract symbols
- Therapy: Body-based interventions for cognitive/emotional issues

# Strevens on Explanatory Depth

## The Core Idea

Michael Strevens argues that good scientific explanations don't just cite causes—they cite the **difference-making** causes while abstracting away irrelevant details.

## The Kairetic Account

Strevens' "kairetic" account (from the Greek word for "decisive moment") says:

An explanation should include:
- All and only the difference-makers
- The causal factors that make a difference to the outcome
- Abstracted to the right level of generality

## Why This Matters

### Against Simple Causation
Not all causes belong in explanations. The presence of oxygen is causally necessary for a fire, but we don't cite it when explaining why a particular fire started—unless oxygen levels were the difference-maker.

### Against Pure Laws
Laws alone don't explain. "Objects fall at 9.8 m/s²" doesn't explain why this particular object fell—we need initial conditions and to show why they mattered.

### The Right Level of Abstraction
Good explanations abstract away details that don't make a difference. We explain genetic inheritance without citing quantum mechanics, not because QM is wrong, but because it's not difference-making at that level.

## Application to Research

This framework helps evaluate explanations:
- Am I citing all the difference-makers?
- Am I including irrelevant causal factors?
- Am I at the right level of abstraction for my explanatory target?

## Tensions and Questions

- How do we identify difference-makers before we have a full causal model?
- Does this work for statistical explanations?
- What about historical explanations where everything matters?

## Connection to My Work

Strevens' framework shapes how I think about:
- Building computational models (what to include?)
- Writing up results (what level of mechanism to cite?)
- Evaluating theories (are they at the right grain?)

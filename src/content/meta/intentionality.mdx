# Intentionality

## The Core Concept

**Intentionality** is the property of mental states whereby they are *about* something, *directed at* something, or *represent* something beyond themselves.

Brentano's thesis: Intentionality is "the mark of the mental" - what distinguishes mental phenomena from physical phenomena.

Your belief is *about* something. Your desire is *for* something. Your perception is *of* something. This "aboutness" or directedness is intentionality.

## Key Features

### 1. Directedness
Mental states point beyond themselves to objects, properties, or states of affairs.

- Belief that *it's raining*
- Desire for *coffee*
- Fear of *heights*

### 2. Content
Intentional states have content - they represent the world as being a certain way.

Two beliefs can have different content even if about the same object:
- "The morning star is bright"
- "The evening star is bright"
(Same object - Venus - different content)

### 3. Intentional Inexistence
You can have mental states about things that don't exist:
- Belief in *unicorns*
- Fear of *ghosts*
- Desire for *perpetual motion machines*

The object of your thought can be "intentionally inexistent" - exists in your mind but not in the world.

## Why This Matters

### Defines the Mental
If intentionality is the mark of the mental, understanding intentionality is understanding what makes mind distinctive.

### Representation Problem
How do physical systems (brains, computers) generate intentional states? This is a central puzzle in philosophy of mind and cognitive science.

### Content Determination
What makes your thought *about* X rather than Y? What determines mental content?

Answers matter for:
- Theory of meaning in language
- Nature of concepts
- Individuation of mental states

## Theories of Intentionality

### Resemblance Theory
Mental representations resemble what they represent (like pictures).

**Problem:** Thoughts can be about abstract things (justice, infinity) that don't resemble anything.

### Causal/Informational Theory
Mental states are about whatever typically causes them. Your "tree" concept is about trees because trees cause "tree" activations.

**Problem:** Misrepresentation. What about false beliefs or hallucinations?

### Functional Role Theory
Content determined by role in cognitive system - inferential connections, behavioral dispositions.

**Problem:** Holism - content depends on entire network of beliefs.

### Teleological Theory
Content determined by proper function. Your "food" detector is about food because detecting food is what it was designed (by evolution) to do.

**Problem:** What grounds "proper" function?

## Application to Research

### Language & Thought
- Words have intentionality (they're *about* things)
- Is linguistic intentionality derived from mental intentionality?
- How does bilingualism affect conceptual content?

### Concepts & Categories
- What makes your "bird" concept about birds?
- Do different languages create different intentional contents?
- Linguistic relativity as question about intentional content

### Computational Models
- Do neural networks have genuine intentionality or just simulate it?
- Chinese Room argument: syntax vs. semantics
- What would ground intentionality in AI systems?

### Mental Representation
- What's the format of mental representations (language-like, image-like, embodied)?
- How do multimodal representations determine content?
- Do different brain regions represent differently?

## Connection to My Work

This framework shapes:
- **Representation questions:** How do bilingual speakers represent concepts? Same content, different languages? Different content?
- **Translation:** What preserves intentional content across languages?
- **Conceptual structure:** Do linguistic categories shape what thoughts can be about?
- **Computational modeling:** What makes a model's states *about* something vs. just correlated?

Examples:
- Cross-linguistic differences in color terms: Different intentional contents or different ways of carving same content?
- Code-switching: Same intentional state, different linguistic expressions? Or shift in content?
- Translation equivalence: When do words in two languages have the same intentional content?

## Related Debates

### Narrow vs. Wide Content
- **Narrow:** Content determined by what's in your head
- **Wide:** Content depends on environment (Twin Earth arguments)
- Matters for: What's psychologically relevant? What explains behavior?

### Original vs. Derived Intentionality
- **Original:** Mind has intrinsic intentionality
- **Derived:** Language, maps, computers have intentionality derived from minds
- Matters for: Can AI have genuine thought?

### Phenomenal vs. Intentional
- Are all mental states intentional?
- What about raw feels, moods without objects?
- Connection between intentionality and consciousness

## Relation to Other Frameworks

- **Functionalism:** Functional role might ground intentional content
- **Embodied Cognition:** Intentionality shaped by sensorimotor engagement
- **Extended Mind:** Can intentionality extend beyond the brain?
- **Representationalism:** All consciousness is intentional (controversial)

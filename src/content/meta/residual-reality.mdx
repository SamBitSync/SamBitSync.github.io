# Residual Reality

## The Core Idea

Evelyn Fox Keller points to the **residual reality** that persists after scientific abstraction—the aspects of the world that remain outside our models, resist formalization, or exceed what our representations can capture.

Science necessarily abstracts: we build models, formalize relationships, identify patterns. But abstraction always leaves something behind. Residual reality is what's left over.

## Not Anti-Science

This isn't a claim that science fails or that we should give up on formalization. It's recognition that:
- Models are **of** reality, not identical to it
- Every act of representation involves selection and omission
- Some aspects of reality may be inherently resistant to certain forms of representation
- The gap between model and world is productive, not just a problem to solve

## Examples

### Ecological Complexity
We can model population dynamics with differential equations, but the actual richness of ecological relationships—the particular qualities of organisms, their histories, the contingencies of their interactions—exceeds what the model captures.

The model is useful. It predicts, explains, guides intervention. But it doesn't exhaust the reality it represents.

### Individual Organisms
In genetics, we abstract DNA sequences, gene expression patterns, protein interactions. But the lived reality of an organism—its development, its responses to environment, its particular trajectory—involves more than these abstractions capture.

### Historical Contingency
Statistical models identify patterns across cases, but the particular history of each case—the sequence of events, the context, the meanings—is residual to the abstraction.

## Why This Matters

### Against Reductionism
Recognizing residual reality means acknowledging that "in principle" reductions may not capture everything worth knowing. The residual isn't just computational complexity or practical limitation.

### For Pluralism
If different abstractions leave different residuals, we may need multiple approaches, multiple models, to engage with reality. Not because we're waiting for the one true model, but because reality exceeds any single formalization.

### Humility in Modeling
When building models, remembering residual reality means:
- Being explicit about what you're leaving out
- Recognizing when the residual matters for your question
- Not mistaking the model for the thing itself

## Application to Research

### Model Building
- What am I abstracting away?
- Does the residual matter for my research question?
- Am I treating the model as exhaustive of the phenomenon?

### Interpretation
- When does the residual reality push back against my model?
- What aspects of the system resist the representation I'm using?
- Are there phenomena that require different forms of knowing?

### Validation
- Model fit doesn't mean capturing everything
- Prediction success doesn't eliminate the residual
- What would it look like to engage with what the model leaves out?

## Tensions and Questions

- How do we talk about what exceeds representation?
- Is residual reality an epistemic limit or an ontological claim?
- Can we distinguish productive abstractions from impoverishing ones?
- Does acknowledging residual reality undermine scientific objectivity?

## Connection to My Work

This framework reminds me to:
- Be modest about what my models capture
- Attend to what gets lost in formalization
- Consider multiple levels of description
- Stay close to the phenomena even when building abstractions

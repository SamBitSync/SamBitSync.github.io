# OODA Loop

## The Four Stages

John Boyd's OODA loop describes how to make decisions in rapidly changing environments:

### 1. Observe
Gather current information from the environment. What's happening? What's changed?

**For research:** What does the data show? What's the current state of the problem? What feedback am I getting?

### 2. Orient
Analyze and synthesize observations in context. Filter information through your mental models, experience, and goals.

**Critical insight:** This is where bias enters. Your orientation shapes what you notice and how you interpret it.

**For research:** How does this fit with what I know? What mental models apply? What am I assuming?

### 3. Decide
Choose a course of action based on your oriented understanding.

**For research:** What's the next experiment? Which parameter to adjust? Which approach to try?

### 4. Act
Execute the decision. Importantly, acting changes the environment, which leads to new observations.

**For research:** Run the experiment. Implement the change. Test the hypothesis.

Then loop back to Observe—because your action has created a new situation.

## Why This Matters

### Speed of Iteration
The advantage goes to whoever can cycle through OODA faster. Faster learning beats perfect planning.

### Adaptation Over Prediction
You don't need to predict the future perfectly. You need to respond quickly to what emerges.

### Orientation is Key
Boyd emphasized "Orient" as the critical phase. Your mental models, cultural traditions, previous experiences shape everything downstream. Bad orientation → bad decisions even with good data.

### Disrupting Others' Loops
In competitive contexts (Boyd's original military application), you want to cycle faster than opponents, forcing them to act on outdated orientations.

## Application to Research

### Iterative Modeling
- Observe: Model fit, residuals, predictions
- Orient: Theory, domain knowledge, similar models
- Decide: What to change (parameters, structure, data)
- Act: Refit the model
- Loop back with new observations

### Experiment Design
- Observe: Pilot results, literature, preliminary data
- Orient: Theory, constraints, feasibility
- Decide: What to test, how to operationalize
- Act: Run the study
- Loop back with results

### Paper Writing
- Observe: Draft, feedback, reviewer comments
- Orient: Goals, audience, argument structure
- Decide: What to revise, what to cut, what to expand
- Act: Rewrite
- Loop back with fresh eyes

## Limitations

- Assumes environments where speed matters (not all research questions require rapid iteration)
- "Orient" can be a black box—doesn't explain how to improve your mental models
- Doesn't address when to stop iterating and commit
- Can lead to reactive rather than strategic thinking if overused

## Tensions

- **Speed vs. Depth:** Fast iteration can mean shallow understanding. When to slow down?
- **Adaptation vs. Principle:** Constantly adapting can lose sight of core questions. When to hold course?
- **Action Bias:** OODA privileges action. Sometimes the right move is to observe longer.

## Connection to My Work

The OODA loop shapes:
- Model development: iterate quickly, don't wait for perfect theory
- Debugging: observe error, orient to likely causes, decide on test, act, repeat
- Learning new methods: try, observe what breaks, orient to why, adjust
- Research questions: observe anomalies, orient to theory, decide what to test, act

It complements Pólya: Pólya for well-defined problems, OODA for uncertain, dynamic situations where the problem itself is shifting.

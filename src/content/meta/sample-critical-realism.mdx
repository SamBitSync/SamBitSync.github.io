# Critical Realism

**Critical Realism** A philosophy of science that separates two dimensions: the intransitive (structures that exist whether we know them or not) and the transitive (our theories and knowledge practices). This separation lets CR be realist about what exists while acknowledging that our knowledge is socially shaped, theory-laden, and fallible.

**Core features:**

- Reality is stratified into irreducible levels
- Mechanisms generate events; we observe some events as experiences
- Mechanisms have causal powers that operate independently of observation
- Higher-level properties emerge from lower levels without being determined by them

Knowledge never directly mirrors reality, yet can still refer to and explain real structures.

## Why Critical Realism?

My computer science undergrad and my cognitive science lab experience equipped me with a standard scientific realist view. Theories get tested, falsified, refined. Reality is out there to be discovered through experiment.

For my Social Science Diploma, my initial research plan was to study cognitive mechanisms in individuals and scale them up to explain social phenomena.

Then I read Durkheim in a social theory course. Social facts are sui generis. Suicide rates, institutional structures, collective representations have causal powers that don't reduce to individual psychology. You can't explain them by aggregating individual cognition.

This broke my scaling-up project plan. This kind of broke my epistemology and I am the type of person who becomes disoriented if there is no coherence. What do you mean it can't be reduced to individual cognition? That's what I do in lab.

Around the same time, I took a critical epistemology course and read Crotty's _Foundations of Social Research_. The interpretive social science arguments were convincing. Knowledge is theory-laden, observation isn't neutral, research is always positioned. But again I was also collecting mousetracking data and epistemological anarchism was deeply uncomfortable to me.

Critical realism resolved both tensions. Ontological stratification means social structures and cognitive mechanisms are both real at different levels. Structures emerge from individual actions but constrain them. Mechanisms enable individuals to navigate structured contexts. Neither reduces to the other. And epistemological fallibilism means I can be realist about both while acknowledging my knowledge is situated and theory-laden.

Both my experimental work and ethnographic work became coherent within the same framework.

## Bhaskar's Stratified Reality

Critical realism distinguishes three nested domains of reality.

**The Real** contains all mechanisms, structures, and causal powers—whether or not they're activated. Cognitive architectures, social structures, chemical bonds exist independently of producing observable events.

**The Actual** is where mechanisms activate and events occur. A neuron fires, a market crashes, someone makes a lexical decision—whether or not anyone observes them.

**The Empirical** is what we can observe and measure. Always smaller than the Actual (we miss most events) and vastly smaller than the Real (most mechanisms remain dormant or unobservable).

**Retroduction**: observe patterns in the Empirical, infer events in the Actual, reason backwards to mechanisms in the Real. Mousetracking reveals cognitive processes. Ethnography reveals social structures. Science moves from surface to depth.

## Three Irreducible Aspects

Reality has three aspects that can't be collapsed into each other.

**Structures** are generative mechanisms—cognitive architectures, social relations, material processes. They exist and have causal powers.

**Events** are what happens when structures activate under specific conditions. They occur in time.

**Experiences** are our observational access through measurement and perception. They appear to us.

The **empiricist mistake**: collapsing structures into experiences ("if we can't observe it, it doesn't exist"). The **idealist mistake**: collapsing events into experiences ("reality is just what we perceive").

**Critical realism**: all three are real, but our knowledge of structures and events is always mediated and fallible.

# Critical Realism and Scientific Practice

This is a sample Meta post demonstrating epistemological framework documentation.

![Critical Realism Structure](/diagrams/criticalrealism.excalidraw.svg)

## Core Tenets

Critical realism distinguishes between:
- **Real**: Mechanisms that exist independently
- **Actual**: Events that occur
- **Empirical**: What we observe

## Application to Research

In trilingual cognition research, this means:
1. Language switching mechanisms exist (Real)
2. Switching events occur in specific contexts (Actual)
3. We measure reaction times and accuracy (Empirical)

## Why This Matters

- Avoids naive empiricism
- Justifies looking for underlying mechanisms
- Explains why RCTs aren't always appropriate
- Guides model selection

## Connections

Links to:
- Bayesian epistemology (how we update beliefs about mechanisms)
- Strevens on depth (how much mechanism to include in explanations)
- Research on cognitive control (the actual empirical work)

## Maturity

This framework is **working** - actively using it to guide research design but still refining the details.

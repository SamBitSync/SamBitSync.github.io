# Computationalism

## The Core Idea

**Cognition is computation.** The mind is like software running on the brain's hardware. Thinking is rule-governed manipulation of symbolic representations.

The brain processes information like a computer:
- **Input:** Sensory data encoded as symbols
- **Processing:** Logical/mathematical operations on symbols
- **Output:** Behavior based on computed results

Mental states are computational states. Beliefs, desires, perceptions are symbolic structures operated on by algorithms.

## Central Theses

### 1. Language of Thought (Fodor)
Mental representations have language-like structure:
- Symbols with syntax and semantics
- Compositional (complex thoughts built from simple ones)
- Productive (finite symbols → infinite thoughts)
- Systematic (if you can think "A loves B," you can think "B loves A")

**Example:** Believing "dogs chase cats" involves mental symbols for DOG, CHASE, CAT in a structured representation.

### 2. Physical Symbol System Hypothesis (Newell & Simon)
A physical symbol system (like a computer or brain) has necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.

Any system that manipulates symbols according to rules can think.

### 3. Multiple Realizability
Same computation can run on different hardware (silicon, neurons, anything). What matters is the algorithm, not the physical substrate.

This supports functionalism - mental states are computational states, multiply realizable.

## Classical Cognitive Architecture

**Information flows through modules:**

```
Perception → Encoding → Central Processing → Output Planning → Action
    ↓           ↓              ↓                    ↓
Symbols    Representations  Inference/Rules    Motor commands
```

- **Modular:** Vision, language, reasoning as separate computational systems
- **Serial processing:** One operation at a time (in classical version)
- **Explicit rules:** If-then logic, production systems
- **Declarative knowledge:** Facts stored as propositions

## Why This Matters

### Legitimates Cognitive Science
If mind is computational, we can study it scientifically:
- Build computational models
- Test predictions
- Reverse-engineer algorithms from behavior

### AI Foundation
Computationalism justified GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI):
- Expert systems
- Logic programming
- Symbolic reasoning

### Level of Explanation
Cognitive science is autonomous from neuroscience. Study algorithms (computational level) independent of implementation (neural level).

## Application to Research

### Modeling Approach
- Formalize cognitive processes as algorithms
- Implement in code
- Test: Does model produce human-like behavior?

**Examples:**
- Production systems for problem-solving
- Semantic networks for memory
- Logic-based models of reasoning

### Language Processing
Computationalism supports:
- Grammar as formal rules (Chomsky's Universal Grammar)
- Parsing as algorithm applying grammatical rules
- Semantics as compositional computation over symbols

**Bilingualism:** Two lexicons, shared or separate computational systems for syntax?

### Theory Structure
Build computational theories:
- What are the symbols?
- What are the operations?
- What's the algorithm?
- What does it compute?

## Critique and Limitations

### Symbol Grounding Problem (Searle)
How do symbols get meaning? Computer symbols are just patterns - they don't mean anything to the computer.

**Chinese Room:** You can manipulate Chinese symbols by rule without understanding Chinese. Is that real understanding?

### Frame Problem
How do you represent all relevant knowledge? Infinite facts potentially matter for any decision. Computationalism seems to require explicitly representing everything.

### Embodiment Challenges
Body and environment matter for cognition, but classical computationalism treats them as mere input/output devices. Maybe cognition isn't brain-bound symbol manipulation.

### Connectionism
Neural networks learn patterns without explicit rules or symbols. Maybe cognition is subsymbolic - distributed patterns, not discrete symbols.

### Dynamical Systems
Maybe cognition is continuous dynamics, not discrete computation. Real-time coupling with environment, not internal symbol manipulation.

### Statistical/Probabilistic Cognition
Humans aren't logic machines. We use heuristics, probabilities, approximate reasoning. Pure symbolic computation is too brittle.

## Contemporary Status

**Not rejected, but:**
- Weakened as sole explanation
- Hybrid models combine symbolic and subsymbolic
- Predictive processing, embodied cognition challenge classical assumptions
- Still valuable for some domains (reasoning, planning, language)

**Where computationalism still works well:**
- High-level reasoning
- Explicit problem-solving
- Language syntax
- Deliberate planning

**Where it struggles:**
- Perception
- Motor control
- Implicit learning
- Context-sensitive cognition

## Connection to My Work

This framework shapes:
- **When to use computational models:** Explicit rule-following (syntax) vs. gradient patterns (semantics)
- **Level of analysis:** When algorithm-level explanation suffices vs. when implementation matters
- **AI comparison:** What LLMs/neural nets do vs. classical symbolic AI
- **Bilingualism:** Are language systems modular computational systems or integrated distributed networks?

Examples:
- Code-switching: Rule-governed computation over two grammars? Or something messier?
- Translation: Symbolic transfer between representations? Or pattern matching?
- Grammatical knowledge: Explicit rules (computationalism) or implicit statistical patterns (connectionism)?

## Relation to Other Frameworks

- **Functionalism:** Computationalism is strongest version of functionalism (mental states = computational states)
- **vs. Embodied Cognition:** Direct opposition - computation in head vs. body-environment coupling
- **vs. Extended Mind:** Computation stays in brain vs. extends into world
- **Intentionality:** Computation might provide account of intentional content (via causal/functional role)
- **Predictive Processing:** Modern version that keeps some computational ideas but adds prediction/inference

# Inventor's Paradox

## The Core Principle

From Pólya's "How to Solve It": **The more ambitious plan may have more chances of success.**

When you're stuck on a specific problem, trying to solve a *more general* version of it can paradoxically make it easier. The general solution often reveals structure that was hidden in the specific case.

## The Paradox

It seems backwards:
- Specific problem → should be easier (fewer constraints)
- General problem → should be harder (more cases to handle)

But often the reverse is true:
- Specific problem → messy, ad-hoc, no clear pattern
- General problem → reveals underlying structure, principled approach

## Examples

### Mathematics
**Specific:** Prove that √2 is irrational.
**General:** Prove that √p is irrational for any prime p.

The general proof is often cleaner—you're forced to identify what makes the argument work (primality), not just manipulate √2 specifically.

### Programming
**Specific:** Debug why this particular API call fails.
**General:** Build a logging/monitoring system for all API calls.

The general solution reveals patterns (timeouts, rate limits, auth expiry) that explain the specific case.

### Research Design
**Specific:** Why do trilingual speakers show this particular interference pattern?
**General:** What are the conditions under which cross-language interference occurs?

The general framing forces you to identify the relevant variables, making predictions about your specific case.

## Why It Works

### Forces Identification of Essence
Generalizing requires identifying what's *essential* vs. *incidental*. This clarifies the problem.

### Reveals Structure
General problems have more obvious structure. You can't rely on specific details, so you find the underlying pattern.

### Enables Transfer
Once you solve the general case, you get all specific cases as corollaries. More return on effort.

### Breaks Fixation
Specific problems can trap you in unproductive framings. Generalizing forces reframing.

## Application to Research

### Stuck on Specific Finding?
Don't just explain this one result. Ask: What class of phenomena does this belong to? What's the general mechanism?

### Model Won't Converge?
Don't just tweak parameters. Ask: What class of models would handle this structure? What's the general solution?

### Literature Review Overwhelming?
Don't catalog every study. Ask: What are the general patterns? What dimensions organize this space?

## Limitations

- Not all problems have useful generalizations
- Can lead to over-abstraction (solving the "wrong" general problem)
- Requires skill to identify the right level of generality
- Can be an avoidance strategy (generalize to avoid the hard specifics)

## Tensions

**Generality vs. Tractability:** More general can also mean more complex. The art is finding the *right* generalization.

**When to Generalize vs. When to Specialize:** Sometimes you need to go deeper into specifics first, then generalize. It's not always the first move.

## Connection to My Work

This principle shapes:
- **Modeling:** When a specific model fails, I ask "what class of models would work here?" rather than endlessly tweaking
- **Debugging:** Build general diagnostics rather than fix specific bugs
- **Theory building:** Look for general mechanisms, not just accounts of specific findings
- **Learning:** Study general frameworks (like this Meta collection) rather than memorize specific facts

Complements the Fundamental Paradox of Social Science: that one says "go general to solve specifics", the other says "go specific to make general claims". They're about different phases—Inventor's for problem-solving, Social Science for inference.

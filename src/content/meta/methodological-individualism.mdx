# Methodological Individualism

## The Core Principle

Social phenomena are to be explained by showing how they result from individual actions, which in turn can be explained by the goals, beliefs, and constraints facing individuals.

**Ontological claim:** Only individuals exist. Social entities (groups, institutions, cultures) are abstractions or aggregations.

**Methodological claim:** Even if you grant that social entities "exist" in some sense, explanations must go through individuals. To explain a revolution, explain why individual people revolted.

## The Argument

### 1. Reality Check
What actually exists? Individual people with beliefs, desires, and capacities. "Society" doesn't act - people do.

### 2. Causal Mechanisms
To understand how X caused Y at the social level, trace the mechanism through individuals. How did this institution shape those people's choices, which led to that outcome?

### 3. Against Black Boxes
Social-level correlations (integration → suicide rates) aren't explanations until you show the individual-level mechanism (integration → social ties → monitoring → prevented suicide).

## Coleman's Boat (Micro-Macro Links)

James Coleman's diagram of proper social explanation:

```
Macro (A) -----> Macro (B)
   |                ^
   |                |
   v                |
Micro (a) -----> Micro (b)
```

To explain macro-level relationship A→B:
1. Show how A affects individuals (A→a)
2. Show how individuals respond (a→b)
3. Show how individual responses aggregate to B (b→B)

Example: Democracy → Economic Growth
1. Democratic institutions → individuals have property rights (A→a)
2. Property rights → individuals invest (a→b)
3. Individual investment → aggregate growth (b→B)

## Versions of Individualism

### Strong Version
All social concepts can be defined in terms of individuals. "Inflation" = weighted average of individual price-setting decisions.

### Moderate Version
Social phenomena must be explained by individual-level mechanisms, but we can use social-level concepts as shorthand.

### Weak Version
Explanations are incomplete without individual-level mechanisms, but we might not always have them.

## Why This Matters

### For Explanation
Forces precision. Can't just say "culture caused X" - must show how culture shaped individual beliefs, which shaped actions, which produced X.

### For Mechanisms
Individualism demands mechanism identification. The micro-macro link is where causation happens.

### Against Reification
Prevents treating abstractions as agents. "The market punished investors" → "Many individual investors sold, prices fell."

## Application to Research

### Model Building
- Agent-based models (simulate individuals, observe macro patterns)
- Rational choice theory (derive outcomes from individual optimization)
- Network analysis (macro structure emerges from individual ties)

### Data Requirements
Need individual-level data to test mechanisms, not just macro correlations.

### Theory Development
Build from micro-foundations. How do individual processes aggregate?

## Limitations and Critiques

### Emergence
Some social phenomena may be genuinely emergent - not predictable from individual properties. Consciousness from neurons? Social norms from interactions?

### Computational Intractability
Even if everything reduces to individuals in principle, computing macro outcomes from micro processes may be impossible.

### Social Facts as Real
Durkheim's response: Social facts constrain individuals, so you can't explain them purely from individual properties that are themselves shaped by social facts.

### The Regression Problem
Individual beliefs and preferences are socially formed. Individualism either: (a) takes them as given (incomplete), or (b) explains them socially (not really individualism).

## Connection to My Work

This framework shapes:
- **Modeling approach:** When to use agent-based models vs. aggregate models
- **Explanation standards:** Am I explaining mechanisms or just documenting correlations?
- **Data needs:** Do I have individual-level data to test the micro-macro link?
- **Theory critique:** Is this explanation reifying abstractions?

Examples:
- Language shift: Not "the community shifted" but individual speakers changed behavior in response to incentives/identities → aggregate pattern
- Cognitive load in multilingualism: Individual processing → affects translation quality → affects institutional outcomes
- Research paradigms: Not "the field believes X" but mechanisms of socialization, gatekeeping, citation networks → consensus

## Relation to Other Frameworks

- **vs. Social Facts:** Direct opposition - can social facts be reduced to individuals?
- **vs. Methodological Holism:** Holism says no, must study social level in its own terms
- **Critical Realism:** Can accommodate individualism at "Actual" level while allowing emergent structures at "Real" level
- **Coleman's Boat:** The paradigmatic tool for individualist explanation

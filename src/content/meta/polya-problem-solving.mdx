# Pólya's Problem-Solving Method

## The Four Phases

George Pólya's "How to Solve It" (1945) outlines a systematic approach to problem-solving:

### 1. Understand the Problem
- What is the unknown? What are the data? What is the condition?
- Is it possible to satisfy the condition?
- Draw a figure. Introduce suitable notation.
- Separate the parts of the condition.

**For research:** What exactly am I trying to explain or predict? What are my constraints?

### 2. Devise a Plan
- Have you seen this problem before? In a slightly different form?
- Do you know a related problem? A useful theorem?
- Could you solve part of the problem?
- Could you derive something useful from the data?

**For research:** What methods have worked for similar questions? What simplifications make this tractable?

### 3. Carry Out the Plan
- Check each step. Can you see clearly that it is correct?
- Can you prove that it is correct?

**For research:** Execute the method systematically. Document what works and what doesn't.

### 4. Look Back
- Can you check the result?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you use the result or method for some other problem?

**For research:** Does the solution make sense? What did I learn about the method? Where else might this apply?

## Why This Matters

### Against Trial and Error
Random attempts waste time. Pólya's method provides structure: understand first, then plan, then execute.

### Metacognitive Awareness
The method forces you to think about your thinking. "Looking back" is where learning happens—not just solving the problem, but understanding the solution.

### Transferable Structure
Works for math problems, research questions, implementation challenges, debugging. The phases adapt to different domains.

## Application to Research

### Problem Formulation
"Understand the problem" prevents solving the wrong question. Forces clarity about what success looks like.

### Method Selection
"Devise a plan" by analogy to solved problems. What worked in related domains?

### Systematic Execution
"Carry out the plan" with checking at each step. Prevents compounding errors.

### Reflection
"Look back" generates insight. What made this hard? What made it tractable? What's generalizable?

## Limitations

- Not all problems have clear phases (some require iterative refinement)
- "Understanding" and "planning" can blur together
- Doesn't address when to abandon an approach
- Works best for well-defined problems

## Connection to My Work

Pólya's method shapes:
- How I approach modeling: understand the phenomenon, plan the model structure, implement, reflect on fit
- How I debug: understand the error, plan a diagnosis strategy, execute tests, reflect on root cause
- How I read papers: understand the question, identify their method, evaluate execution, extract generalizable insights

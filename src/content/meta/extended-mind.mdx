# Extended Mind

## The Core Thesis

Cognitive processes ain't (all) in the head. When external tools function as seamless extensions of internal cognition, they literally constitute part of the cognitive system.

**Parity Principle (Clark & Chalmers):**
If a process would be counted as cognitive were it to occur in the head, then it should count as cognitive even if it partially occurs outside the head.

The mind extends into notebooks, smartphones, calculators, even other people.

## The Classic Example: Otto and Inga

**Inga** wants to visit MoMA. She recalls the address from memory and goes there.

**Otto** has Alzheimer's. He writes important information in a notebook he always carries. He looks up MoMA's address in his notebook and goes there.

**Question:** Does Otto *know* MoMA's address (before looking it up)?

**Extended Mind answer:** Yes. The notebook functions for Otto like biological memory functions for Inga. It's reliably there, automatically endorsed, constantly accessible. The notebook is part of Otto's cognitive system. His belief is partially constituted by notebook entries.

## Criteria for Cognitive Extension

What makes something part of your extended mind rather than just a tool?

### 1. Constant Availability
Reliably present when needed (like biological memory is always there).

### 2. Automatic Endorsement
Information is trusted by default (like you trust your memories without checking).

### 3. Easy Accessibility
Low effort to access (like recalling from memory).

### 4. Historical Role
Information has been consciously endorsed in the past and has shaped behavior since.

When external resources meet these criteria, they're not just aids - they're *constitutive* of cognitive states.

## Types of Extension

### Cognitive Scaffolding
Environment structured to reduce cognitive load:
- To-do lists
- File hierarchies
- Organized workspaces
- Labels and signs

### Embodied Tools
Physical manipulations as thinking:
- Gestures while explaining
- Arranging Scrabble tiles
- Physical model manipulation
- Counting on fingers

### Social Extension
Other people as cognitive resources:
- Collaborative problem-solving where the group collectively knows things no individual knows
- Division of cognitive labor
- Transactive memory systems (couples who know what the other knows)

### Linguistic Extension
Language as cognitive technology:
- Written language for stable long-term storage
- Technical vocabularies for precision
- Mathematical notation for complex reasoning

## Why This Matters

### Against Internalism
Cognitive science shouldn't focus only on what's in the brain. The unit of analysis is brain-body-environment system.

### For Design
If mind extends into environment, we can improve cognition by improving environment:
- Better note-taking systems
- Smarter tools
- Designed spaces that think for you

### Philosophical Implications
- Where does "you" end and world begin?
- Personal identity: Are you your memories? (What if they're in smartphone?)
- Privacy: If mind extends to devices, hacking them accesses your mind

## Critiques and Limitations

### Coupling-Constitution Fallacy
**Objection:** External tools are *causally* coupled to cognition but don't *constitute* it. Otto and notebook interact, but only Otto thinks.

**Reply:** Where to draw boundary? Brain and body are causally coupled too. Why is body-notebook coupling different from brain-body coupling?

### Cognitive Bloat
**Objection:** Everything I interact with becomes part of my mind? The library? Google? The entire internet?

**Reply:** No - only what meets the criteria (reliable, endorsed, accessible, etc.). Most external info doesn't qualify.

### Marks of the Cognitive
**Objection:** Real cognition has properties external processes lack (portability, integration, phenomenology).

**Reply:** Depends which properties are essential to cognition. Functionalists would say only causal role matters.

## Application to Research

### Multilingualism
- Is second language an extended cognitive tool or part of core cognitive system?
- Bilinguals extend cognitive capacity through language switching
- Language choice as cognitive scaffolding strategy

### Digital Technology
- How do devices change cognitive strategies?
- Students offload memory to notes/phones - extended memory or memory impairment?
- Navigation apps - extended spatial cognition or atrophy of internal maps?

### Collaborative Cognition
- Research teams as distributed cognitive systems
- No individual understands whole project
- Knowledge distributed across lab members, equipment, datasets

### Literacy
- Writing transforms cognition (extends memory, enables abstraction)
- Different scripts = different cognitive affordances?
- Is literacy a cognitive extension or cognitive change?

## Connection to My Work

This framework shapes:
- **Unit of analysis:** Study brain-in-context, not brain alone
- **Cognitive offloading:** When bilinguals use L2 for certain tasks, is that extended cognition?
- **Tools and technology:** Language itself as cognitive technology
- **Methods:** Include environmental resources in cognitive models

Examples:
- Dictionary use while writing: Extended lexical knowledge or just a tool?
- Code-switching for cognitive offloading: Using L2 for numbers, technical terms
- Note-taking in multilingual contexts: Which language for which information?
- Translation tools: Extend translator's competence or replace it?

## Relation to Other Frameworks

- **Functionalism:** Extended Mind assumes functionalist criterion (if same role, same state)
- **Embodied Cognition:** Both reject brain-bound cognition, but Extended Mind goes further (beyond body into world)
- **Situated Cognition:** Environment shapes cognition (weaker than Extended Mind's constitution claim)
- **Intentionality:** Does extended mind have derived or original intentionality?

## Variants and Extensions

### Scaffolded Mind
Weaker version: Environment provides scaffolding, but mind stays in head.

### Embedded Cognition
Cognition is embedded in environment (causal dependence) without being extended into it (constitution).

### Enacted Cognition
Cognition is constituted by sensorimotor engagements with environment (even stronger than Extended Mind).

### Distributed Cognition
Focus on systems (crew flying plane, team doing science) rather than individuals. Cognitive properties of whole system.

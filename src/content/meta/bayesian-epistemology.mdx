# Bayesian Epistemology

## The Core Idea

**Probability is not about the world - it's about our beliefs.**

Traditional (frequentist) view: Probability = long-run frequency. "50% chance of heads" means in infinite flips, half are heads.

Bayesian view: Probability = degree of belief. "50% credence in heads" means you're maximally uncertain which outcome will occur.

**Beliefs should be:**
1. Represented as probabilities (degrees of confidence from 0 to 1)
2. Coherent (satisfy probability axioms)
3. Updated by Bayes' rule when you get evidence

## Bayes' Rule

The fundamental equation for rational belief updating:

```
P(H|E) = P(E|H) × P(H) / P(E)
```

- **P(H)**: Prior probability of hypothesis H (before seeing evidence)
- **P(E|H)**: Likelihood of evidence E given H is true
- **P(H|E)**: Posterior probability of H (after seeing evidence)
- **P(E)**: Marginal probability of evidence

**In words:** Your new belief = (how well H predicts E) × (your old belief) / (how expected E was overall)

## Why This Matters

### Against Binary Belief
Don't just believe/disbelieve. Have graded confidence. "I'm 70% confident it will rain."

### Incorporates Priors
You don't start from scratch each time. Prior knowledge matters. Rational updating preserves what you already knew while adapting to new evidence.

### Formal Rationality
Clear normative standard for belief revision. You can be objectively wrong about how to update beliefs.

### Quantifies Uncertainty
Make uncertainty explicit. Forces precision about confidence levels.

## Epistemic vs. Objective Probability

**Crucial distinction:**

**Objective (frequentist):** Probability is property of world
- Dice have objective probabilities
- Repeatable experiments have limiting frequencies
- Only meaningful for physical processes

**Epistemic (Bayesian):** Probability is state of knowledge
- You can have probability about anything (even one-time events)
- "Probability Napoleon won at Waterloo" makes sense (your uncertainty about history)
- Subjective but constrained by rationality

**This is why Bayesian epistemology is powerful:**
- Can reason about unique events ("will this specific startup succeed?")
- Can update beliefs about theories, hypotheses, historical events
- Not limited to repeatable experiments

## Application to Research

### Study Design
- Specify prior beliefs explicitly
- Design experiments to maximize expected information gain
- Smaller samples okay if you have strong priors + high-quality data

### Statistical Inference
Bayesian statistics vs. frequentist:
- **Frequentist:** p-values, confidence intervals (what would happen in hypothetical repetitions)
- **Bayesian:** Posterior distributions, credible intervals (what you should believe given the data)

Bayesian answers the question you actually care about: "What should I believe about this parameter?"

### Model Comparison
Use Bayes factors to compare hypotheses:
- How much more likely is the data under H1 vs. H2?
- Automatically penalizes complexity (Occam's razor falls out of Bayes' rule)

### Sequential Updating
Update beliefs as data accumulates:
- Today's posterior = tomorrow's prior
- No need to wait for "large N"
- Continuous learning process

## Connection to My Work

This framework shapes:
- **Inference:** How to draw conclusions from limited data
- **Uncertainty quantification:** Explicit about confidence in claims
- **Model building:** Prior specification, hierarchical models
- **Learning:** Belief updating in second language acquisition

Examples:
- Bilingual language choice: Bayesian inference about which language to use given context
- Translation confidence: Posterior probability distributions over translations
- Grammaticality judgments: Graded acceptability as posterior probabilities
- Experimental analysis: Bayesian mixed-effects models for multilingual data

## Critiques and Limitations

### Subjectivity of Priors
Different people have different priors. Is this rational disagreement?
- **Response:** Priors reflect different background knowledge. With enough data, posteriors converge.

### Where Do Priors Come From?
If you need priors to start, isn't this circular?
- **Response:** Priors come from previous inquiry, evolution, general principles. Ultimately some priors are bedrock.

### Computational Intractability
Exact Bayesian inference often impossible to compute.
- **Response:** Approximations (MCMC, variational inference) work well in practice.

### Doesn't Capture All Rationality
Not all rational belief revision is Bayesian. What about non-probabilistic reasoning?
- **Response:** Bayesianism is normative for uncertainty, not all reasoning.

## Relation to Other Frameworks

- **Critical Realism:** Bayesian inference about unobservable mechanisms in Real domain
- **Predictive Processing:** Brain implements approximate Bayesian inference
- **Computationalism:** Bayesian inference as computational process
- **Methodological Individualism:** Individual agents as Bayesian reasoners
- **Hard to Vary:** Good explanations have low prior probability but high likelihood given data

## Variants

### Subjective Bayesianism (Ramsey, de Finetti)
Probabilities are purely subjective degrees of belief. Only constraint is coherence.

### Objective Bayesianism (Jaynes)
Probabilities should reflect objective constraints (MaxEnt principle). Unique rational prior given information.

### Empirical Bayes
Estimate priors from data itself. Hybrid of Bayesian and frequentist.

### Bayesian Decision Theory
Extend to actions: Choose action that maximizes expected utility given beliefs.

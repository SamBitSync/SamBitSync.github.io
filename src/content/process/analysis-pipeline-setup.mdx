# Setting Up Analysis Pipeline for Behavioral Data

## Goal

Create a fully reproducible analysis pipeline that takes raw behavioral data and produces:
- Cleaned datasets
- Descriptive statistics
- Statistical models
- Publication-ready figures

## Current Status

**What's Working:**
- Data import scripts handle multiple formats
- Basic cleaning pipeline removes invalid trials
- Automated checks for data quality

**In Progress:**
- Standardizing variable names across experiments
- Building visualization templates
- Documenting assumptions for future me

**Blocked:**
- Need to decide on statistical approach for nested data
- Waiting for lab meeting discussion on exclusion criteria

## Implementation Notes

### Directory Structure
```
data/
  raw/          # Never touch these
  processed/    # Output from cleaning scripts
  final/        # Analysis-ready data

scripts/
  00_import.R
  01_clean.R
  02_analyze.R
  03_visualize.R

output/
  figures/
  tables/
  models/
```

### Key Decisions

**Data Format:** Long format for everything. Wide formats create too many headaches.

**Missing Data:** Explicit NA, never empty cells. Document why data is missing.

**Naming:** `snake_case` for variables, `PascalCase` for functions, `SCREAMING_CASE` for constants.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Version control everything.** Even data dictionaries. Especially data dictionaries.

2. **Write code for future you.** You won't remember why you excluded those trials.

3. **Automate checks.** If you're manually checking data, you'll miss something.

4. **Document as you go.** "I'll document this later" is a lie we tell ourselves.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Standardize column names across all datasets
- [ ] Write tests for cleaning functions
- [ ] Create template for analysis reports
- [ ] Set up automated pipeline with `targets` package

## Questions to Resolve

- How to handle practice trials? Exclude or analyze separately?
- What's the right threshold for reaction time outliers?
- Should we log-transform RTs before analysis?

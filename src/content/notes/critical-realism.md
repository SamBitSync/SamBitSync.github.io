## Core Insight

Critical realism, primarily developed by Roy Bhaskar, offers a **stratified ontology** that distinguishes between the empirical (what we observe), the actual (events that occur), and the real (underlying causal mechanisms). This framework provides a middle path between naive empiricism and constructivism.

## Three Domains of Reality

**The Empirical**: What we can observe and measure
- Experimental results, survey data, observable behaviors
- Always partial and theory-laden
- The domain of traditional empiricism

**The Actual**: Events that occur (whether observed or not)
- Real happenings in the world
- May not be directly observable
- Includes counterfactual events

**The Real**: Underlying causal mechanisms and structures
- Powers, tendencies, and capacities of objects
- May be inactive or counteracted by other mechanisms
- The fundamental level that generates events

## Implications for Research

### Methodological Pluralism
Critical realism supports using different methods to access different levels:
- **Quantitative**: Good for identifying patterns in the empirical domain
- **Qualitative**: Better for understanding actual events and real mechanisms
- **Mixed methods**: Can triangulate across domains

### Explanation vs Prediction
- Focus shifts from prediction (empiricist goal) to explanation of underlying mechanisms
- Retroduction: Working backwards from effects to likely causes
- Understanding why something works, not just that it works

## Personal Application

This framework helps me think about my trilingual cognition research:
- **Empirical**: Reaction times, error rates in experiments
- **Actual**: Cognitive switching events, interference patterns
- **Real**: Underlying neural mechanisms, cultural-linguistic structures

It also informs my Nepal-based research approach—understanding how local contexts (real domain) generate specific social patterns (actual) that may differ from what surveys capture (empirical).

## Tensions and Questions

**Realism vs Social Construction**: How do we balance acknowledgment of real structures with recognition that human meanings shape social reality?

**Access Problem**: If real mechanisms are often unobservable, how do we avoid speculation while doing more than describing patterns?

**Cultural Specificity**: Are the causal mechanisms we identify universal, or do they vary across cultural contexts? This is particularly relevant for cognitive science research.

## Connection to Current Work

Critical realism provides a philosophical foundation for:
1. **Interpretive social science**: Taking seriously both social construction and underlying structures
2. **Cross-cultural research**: Understanding how universal mechanisms manifest differently in different contexts
3. **Methodological choices**: Justifying why different research questions require different approaches

*This framework helps bridge the gap between rigorous scientific methodology and recognition of interpretive complexity—essential for research that spans cultures and disciplines.*

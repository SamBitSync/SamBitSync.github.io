## Core Proposition

Different manifestations of complexity require fundamentally different analytical approaches. Rather than seeking a unified theory of complexity, this framework advocates for **methodological pluralism**â€”systematically matching analytical tools to the specific nature of complexity encountered.

## Framework Structure

### Five Domains of Complexity

1. **Algorithmic Complexity**
   - Nature: Computational resource scaling
   - Tools: Big-O analysis, approximation algorithms
   - Context: Software optimization, algorithm design

2. **Cognitive Complexity** 
   - Nature: Mental processing load and working memory constraints
   - Tools: Decomposition, progressive disclosure, scaffolding
   - Context: Interface design, educational systems, knowledge work

3. **Systems Complexity**
   - Nature: Nonlinear dynamics, emergence, feedback loops
   - Tools: Agent-based modeling, network analysis, simulation
   - Context: Organizational design, ecosystem management

4. **Social Complexity**
   - Nature: Cultural meaning-making, power dynamics, reflexivity
   - Tools: Ethnography, thick description, participatory mapping
   - Context: Policy design, community intervention

5. **Epistemological Complexity**
   - Nature: Theory-dependence, model uncertainty, unknowable unknowns
   - Tools: Robustness testing, triangulation, ensemble methods
   - Context: Scientific research, decision-making under uncertainty

### Selection Criteria

**Context Sensitivity**: Match method to the specific manifestation of complexity
**Pragmatic Effectiveness**: Prioritize approaches that yield actionable insights
**Methodological Rigor**: Maintain standards appropriate to each domain
**Integration Capacity**: Enable synthesis across different complexity types

## Academic Applications

This framework has been applied in:
- Research methodology design for interdisciplinary projects
- Complex systems analysis in organizational contexts
- Knowledge synthesis across disparate domains
- Graduate-level coursework in complexity science

## Epistemological Foundations

Draws from:
- **Scientific Pragmatism** (Dewey, James)
- **Methodological Pluralism** (Feyerabend, Cartwright)
- **Complex Systems Theory** (Holland, Miller, Page)
- **Cognitive Science** (Simon, Kahneman)

## Future Development

Current work extends this framework toward:
- Cross-cultural applications (Nepal-Western contexts)
- Digital knowledge management systems
- Academic research methodology

*This framework represents ongoing doctoral-level work in epistemology and methodology.*

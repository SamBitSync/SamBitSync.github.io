## Why I'm Doing This

I kept running into research questions that seemed like they needed computational approaches, but my background is more in experimental psychology and linguistics. So I decided to teach myself computational modeling, starting from basically zero programming experience.

The specific motivation was trying to understand how trilingual language control might work as a complex adaptive system, rather than just looking at it through traditional cognitive psychology frameworks.

## What I'm Learning

### Starting with Python Basics
- Working through "Automate the Boring Stuff" to get basic programming concepts down
- Lots of fumbling around with syntax and trying to think in computational terms
- Still confused about when to use different data structures, but getting better

### Agent-Based Modeling
- Using NetLogo to build simple models of language switching
- Trying to model trilingual speakers as agents with different language activation patterns
- Very basic right now, but starting to see how computational thinking is different from experimental thinking

### Network Analysis
- Learning NetworkX to map connections between languages, contexts, and cognitive control
- Fascinating to see trilingual language systems as networks rather than just cognitive processes
- Still figuring out what metrics actually mean in practical terms

## Current Projects

### Simple Language Switching Model
Building an agent-based model where trilingual "agents" have to navigate different linguistic environments. Each agent has activation levels for three languages that change based on context.

Super basic right now, but even this simple version is revealing assumptions I had about how language control works.

### Personal Language Network
Mapping my own language use patterns as a network - which languages I use with which people, in which contexts, for which purposes. Partly for fun, partly to see if network analysis reveals patterns I hadn't noticed.

### Complexity Reading Group (of One)
Working through "Thinking in Systems" by Donella Meadows and "Complexity: A Guided Tour" by Melanie Mitchell, trying to connect systems thinking concepts to language and cognition research.

## What's Hard About This

### Math Background
I'm having to learn statistics and linear algebra concepts as I go, which slows everything down. Khan Academy has become my friend.

### Computational Thinking
It's a different way of thinking about problems. Instead of designing experiments, you're building little worlds and seeing what happens. Still wrapping my head around this.

### Connecting to Real Research
Lots of computational models seem really abstract. I'm trying to keep connecting everything back to actual human language behavior, but it's not always obvious how.

## What I'm Discovering

### Different Questions Become Possible
Computational approaches let you ask "what if" questions that would be impossible to test experimentally. Like, what if trilingual control works more like an ecosystem than a switching mechanism?

### Emergent Properties
Even simple models can produce unexpected behaviors that might explain some of the patterns we see in real trilingual speakers.

### Humility About Complexity
Actually trying to model language systems computationally has made me realize how much we don't understand about how this stuff really works.

## Where This Is Going

I want to eventually build models that could inform experimental design - using computational approaches to generate hypotheses that we could then test with real people.

Also interested in how computational literacy could be integrated into psychology and linguistics training more broadly. Most of us learn to design experiments but not to build models.

*This has been incredibly frustrating and incredibly rewarding. I spend a lot of time feeling stupid, but then occasionally something clicks and I see a connection I wouldn't have seen otherwise.*

## Why I Started Writing About This

Most cognitive science research I read feels like it's written from this very specific Western academic perspective, where certain assumptions about education, language use, and even basic concepts like "individual vs. collective identity" are just taken for granted.

But doing research here in Nepal, I keep noticing moments where those assumptions don't quite fit. So I started writing about what it actually feels like to do this work from a different cultural context.

## What I'm Writing About

### Research Process Differences

Things like how participant recruitment works differently when your society is more relationship-based, or how concepts like "individual cognitive control" get complicated when your whole linguistic environment is fundamentally collaborative.

### Language and Thought

The whole Sapir-Whorf debate feels different when you're thinking in Nepali but writing in English about research conducted in three languages. There are concepts in Nepali that don't map neatly onto English cognitive science terminology, and that creates interesting translation challenges.

### Science Communication

How do you explain cognitive science concepts to family members who think very differently about how the mind works? My grandmother has her own theories about language and memory that are actually pretty sophisticated, just not framed in academic language.

## Pieces I'm Working On

### "The Trilingual Mind" (Personal Essay)
About growing up trilingual and then studying trilingual brains - the weird experience of being both researcher and research subject.

### "Laboratory vs. Life" (Research Reflection)
How the controlled laboratory environment captures some aspects of language switching but misses others that are obvious if you just observe how people actually use languages in daily life.

### "Translating Cognition" (Academic Piece)
More formal exploration of how cultural concepts of mind and self affect how we design and interpret cognitive science research.

## The Challenge

I want to write in a way that's honest about the limitations of current research while still being respectful of the scientific process. It's not about saying "Western science is wrong" but more like "here are some blind spots that become visible from a different vantage point."

## Where This Is Going

I'm hoping to eventually publish some of these pieces, maybe in science communication outlets or journals that focus on cross-cultural research. But right now I'm mostly just trying to figure out how to write about science in a way that feels authentic to my actual experience.

The goal isn't to be critical for the sake of being critical, but to add perspectives that might make the research better and more complete.

*This writing has been surprisingly difficult because I'm trying to balance being a legitimate researcher while also being honest about what I observe from my cultural position. It's a weird line to walk.*

## What We're Trying to Figure Out

I'm working on understanding how people who speak three languages—specifically Nepali, English, and Newari—actually manage to switch between them without their brain turning into complete chaos.

Most research on multilingualism focuses on bilinguals, but here in Nepal, lots of people grow up with three languages that they use in different contexts. Like, you might speak Nepali at home, English at school, and Newari with friends or in traditional cultural contexts.

## The Actual Research

We're running experiments where trilingual participants do language-switching tasks while we record their brain activity with EEG. The basic idea is to see what happens in their heads when they have to rapidly switch between languages, compared to when they're just sticking with one.

### What We've Found So Far

The interesting thing is that trilingual brains seem to develop different control strategies than bilingual ones. Instead of just having an "on/off" switch for each language, there's this more complex system that seems to prioritize languages based on context.

For example, when someone's in "academic mode," English becomes more dominant and it's easier to switch between English and Newari (depending on the educational context) than to bring in Nepali for family conversations.

### Why This Matters

Understanding trilingual cognitive control could help with:
- Better language education strategies in multilingual societies
- Understanding how the brain adapts to complex linguistic environments
- Insights into cognitive flexibility more generally

## Personal Context

Working on this project has been fascinating because I'm studying something I live every day. I switch between these same three languages (though my Newari is admittedly weaker than my Nepali and English), and now I'm trying to understand the neural mechanisms behind something that feels completely automatic.

There's also something interesting about doing cognitive science research in Nepal - most of the existing literature comes from Western contexts, but linguistic diversity here offers insights you can't get elsewhere.

## Technical Challenges

- **EEG artifacts**: People move their mouths differently when speaking different languages, which creates movement artifacts in the brain recordings
- **Stimulus design**: Creating equivalent tasks across three very different languages is harder than you'd think
- **Cultural context**: Some concepts don't translate directly, so you have to be creative about experimental design

## What's Next

We're expanding the study to include different trilingual combinations (like Nepali-English-Tibetan speakers) to see if the patterns hold up across different language families.

I'm also working on a follow-up study looking at how trilingual language control changes in different emotional states, since people often have different emotional associations with different languages.

*This is my first real research project, and it's been a steep learning curve, but fascinating to see how messy and complex real cognitive science actually is compared to what you read in textbooks.*

## Project Overview

Interactive digital divide storymap project for Bhimdhunga, Nagarjun that visualizes household-level digital access stories through an interactive map interface. The project contrasts official digital divide statistics with lived experiences of residents, highlighting the gap between quantitative data and qualitative realities of digital access.

Completed as part of All In Solutions fellowship.

## The Challenge

Official statistics on digital access often present a simplified picture that doesn't capture the nuanced realities of how people actually experience and navigate digital connectivity. In Bhimdhunga, while government data might show certain coverage levels, the lived experience of residents tells a much more complex story.

## Approach

### Mixed Methods Design
- **Quantitative mapping**: Official infrastructure and access data
- **Qualitative storytelling**: Household interviews and digital access narratives
- **Interactive visualization**: Web-based storymap that lets users explore both perspectives

### Community Engagement
Rather than extracting data about the community, the project involves residents as collaborators in telling their own digital access stories. This participatory approach reveals insights that purely quantitative surveys would miss.

## Technical Implementation

### Interactive Map Interface
- Household-level data visualization
- Story points that users can click to explore individual narratives
- Layered data showing infrastructure vs. actual access experiences
- Mobile-responsive design for accessibility

### Data Integration
- Official telecommunications infrastructure data
- Survey responses from community members
- Qualitative interviews and digital diaries
- Geographic and demographic context

## Key Findings

### The Gap Between Stats and Stories
Official coverage maps show Bhimdhunga as having reasonable digital access, but resident stories reveal:
- Intermittent connectivity that makes sustained digital work difficult
- Economic barriers that aren't captured in infrastructure data
- Generational and gender differences in digital access and use
- Creative workarounds that residents develop to navigate connectivity challenges

### Community Innovation
Despite connectivity challenges, residents have developed sophisticated strategies for maximizing their digital access, including shared resources, strategic timing of internet use, and community networks for digital support.

## Fellowship Context

This project was completed as part of the All In Solutions fellowship, which focuses on community-centered approaches to development challenges. The fellowship provided both technical support and a framework for ensuring the project served community needs rather than external research agendas.

## Impact and Applications

### For Bhimdhunga Community
- Visual tool that residents can use to advocate for better digital infrastructure
- Documentation of community innovation and resilience
- Resource for local development planning

### For Digital Divide Research
- Model for combining quantitative infrastructure data with qualitative experience data
- Demonstration of participatory mapping approaches
- Evidence for the importance of lived experience in understanding digital access

## Technical Challenges

### Data Privacy and Ethics
Working with household-level data required careful attention to privacy and consent, especially given the sensitive nature of economic and social information.

### Balancing Complexity and Accessibility
Creating a visualization that could represent complex, nuanced stories while remaining accessible to diverse audiences, including community members with varying levels of digital literacy.

### Sustainability
Ensuring the project could be maintained and updated by community members rather than becoming dependent on external technical support.

## What's Next

Currently working on:
- Training community members to update and maintain the storymap
- Exploring replication in other communities
- Academic publication about the methodology and findings
- Integration with local development planning processes

*This project has been a fascinating exploration of how interactive digital tools can bridge the gap between data and lived experience, while centering community voices in research about their own digital realities.*
